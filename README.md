## Hi there 🐧

I'm **Jade**, a senior at Ohio University studying Computer Science, with a minor in Finance and a certificate in Financial Programming.

Currently, I'm studying abroad in **Edinburgh, Scotland**, focusing on environment and sustainability. I hope to bring this interdisciplinary perspective into my work as a future software engineer — blending technical skill with global awareness and purpose-driven design.

### 👩‍💻 What I Bring

- 💡 **Frameworks**: Angular, Node, Kubernetes, Docker & Rancher
- 🛠 **Languages**: Typescript, C++, SQL, Python
- ☁️ **Concepts**: Databases, OOP, UI/UX Design, CI/CD

### 💼 Experience

At Ohio University, I’ve worked as a student developer for the Student Software Engineering Program. In this role, I’ve:

- Gained experience with modern dev workflows
- Upgraded Angular and Node.js applications
- Integrated new features to in-production university built applications

### 🌿 Outside the Terminal

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me:

- 🍰 Baking something sweet
- 📚 Reading (currently on a Brandon Sanderson binge!)
- 🥾 Hiking new trails
- ✈️ Traveling and learning wherever I go
