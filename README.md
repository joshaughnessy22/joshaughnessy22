## Hi there 🐧
I'm **Jade**, a senior at Ohio University studying Computer Science, with a minor in Finance and a certificate in Financial Programming.

Currently, I'm studying abroad in **Edinburgh, Scotland**, focusing on environment and sustainability. I hope to bring this interdisciplinary perspective into my work as a future software engineer — blending technical skill with global awareness and purpose-driven design.

For two years, I’ve worked as a student developer for the Student Software Engineering Program ([SSEP](https://www.ohio.edu/oit/career-opportunities/student-employment/student-programs/ssep)). In this role, I’ve:

- Gained experience with modern dev workflows
- Integrated new features to in-production university built applications
- Upgraded Angular and Node.js applications

Overall, I've have the opportunity to view and contribute to a bunch of really cool repos managed by OIT! 

### 🌿 When I’m not coding, you’ll find me

- 🍰 Baking something sweet
- 📚 Reading (currently on a Brandon Sanderson binge!)
- 🥾 Hiking new trails
- ✈️ Traveling and learning wherever I go
